# FIBONACCI
## Introduction
   This API Rest in Spring Boot return the value fibonacci of a integer positive number. If the number is minor 1 return the same number.

   Examples: the first values of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., so, if we were to give the API the index n=3, 
   
   we should get the response value "2", and if we request n=6, we should get "8" as the response, and so on.
